- **Multi-Sensory**: Visual, audio, and touch interactions
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time visual responses
- **Achievement Recognition**: Glowing effects for success

### 🚀 **Usage in Your Division Game**

You can now integrate these enhanced marbles into your existing game:

```dart
// Replace standard marbles with transformation stages
EnhancedMarbleWidget(
  size: 40,
  stage: playerLevel, // 1-4 based on progress
  isGlowing: isCorrectAnswer,
  onTap: () => handleMarbleTap(),
)

// Show transformation progress
MarbleTransformationWidget()

// Educational grouping containers
EducationalMarbleContainer(
  marbles: gameMarbles,
